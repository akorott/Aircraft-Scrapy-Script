# Aircraft-Scrapy-Script

This is a Scrapy script I created for Python in order to scrape data from www.avbuyer.com

The purpose of this was to scrape and then analyze the different features that impact the price of used and new aircraft. 

Attributes scraped:

- Make
- Model
- Type of aircraft
- Year
- Price
- Location
- Serial number
- Registration number
- Total hours
- Engine details
- Airframe details
- Interior details
- Exterior details
- Aircraft highlights
- Additional equipment details
- APU details
